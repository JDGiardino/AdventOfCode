# Advent-of-Code-22
I will be storing my solutions to the [Advent of Code event for 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022) in this repostiory! 

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is an [Advent calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advent_calendar) of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, a speed contest, or to challenge each other.
